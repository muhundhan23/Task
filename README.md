Flutter 3.0.2, and the dart version in 2.17.3 (Which only runs in Flutter 3.0.2).
    Please make sure the flutter version in up to date.

Totally concentrated in getting the list and displaying it.
(Didn't concentrate much on the design side)

I couldn't find the network image url in the event list.

I could have separated the page for Api and for the font styles.
(Trying to finish this task as soon as possible)
